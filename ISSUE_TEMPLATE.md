GitHub issues are for bugs / installation problems / feature requests.

To make bugs and feature requests more easy to find and organize, we close issues that are deemed
out of scope for GitHub Issues.

For bugs or installation issues, please provide the following information.
The more information you provide, the more easily we will be able to offer
help and advice.
